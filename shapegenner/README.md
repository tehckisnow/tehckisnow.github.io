//TODO:

// This code is ridiculously messy and overcomplicated. Refactor everything!

// set up configuration file to be able to easily set all parameters
// support typing in color codes for custom palettes
// consider accessing coolors API if it is accessible, or webscraping?
// or write a script for generating pleasing palettes (this might be tough)
// Accept "current" as an acceptable value
// Support more shapes: Ellipse, Star, Polygon, Line
// Support transformations to objects
// replace objects with <g> ?
// finish shape.Transform so that multiple transforms do not override one another
// convert individual transform functions to use the new shape.Transform so they do not override one another

-- -- COMPLETED -- --

//// simple functions to create each basic primitive
//// simple functions to EDIT each basic primitive
//// link reference to these edit functions for easy utility and auto reference to this
//// set up all params that will be used
//// set up randomizer and link to params
//// Each new shape is a different color
//// colors are pulled from a palette,
