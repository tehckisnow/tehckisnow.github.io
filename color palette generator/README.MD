TODO:
//- use HSL or HSLA to generate random colors
- generate color palettes (different kinds, select from different UI controls)
  //random
  monochromatic
  complementary
  split complementary
  triadic
  achromatic
  analogous
  tetradic

- draw or show color wheel and overlay lines indicating color relationships

- better style theming

//- draw as palette (a series of adjacent squares)
- optionally convert to different color formats
//- easily copy color codes from palettes by clicking on a color
//- (indicator or tooltip to show color has been copied)


- after clicking "generate palette" to gen a palette, clicking "add color" should add colors according to the selected palette type (?)
- just clicking "add color" in general should abide by the currently selected palette type (?)




IDEAS:
- choose dominant color, generate complimentary colors, and accent colors

- rearrange buttons and options to group them more reasonably?

- reformat for mobile devices (responsive design)
